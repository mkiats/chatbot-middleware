# NextJs GUI
- Deployment Form (Take in chatbot-name & zip files)
- Deployment lifecycle, form querying and pipeline showcase, deploy with telegram support, or without telegram support

- Documentation & Bug upload form
- Login Form at landing page (Theoretically should use ntu.edu.sg auth)


# Azure Telegram
Need to change partition key to something index-able, instead of uuid
- ChatbotDb maybe can partition by status
- Pagination for /list command
- Exception handling
- Authentication


# Azure GUI Deployment
- Create exceptions to handle custom errors
- Try Except for AzureFunctionDeployer initialisation
- Bug: Deployment fails when using in the cloud, suspect authentication issue with the DefaultCredentials. Find way to authenticate without using 'az login', Can try EnvironmentalCredentials
- Chatbot deployed via Azure functions should be added to CosmosDb (Backend endpoint to create chatbot)
- Chatbot name validator method (AzureFunctionDeployer)


# Workshop (Week3-4)
- Go through FYP
